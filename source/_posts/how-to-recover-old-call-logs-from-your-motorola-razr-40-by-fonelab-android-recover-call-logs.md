  "Fed up with massive data in my Motorola Razr 40, I was going to delete some files and speed up my Motorola Razr 40. I thought call logs were useless and erased them without consideration. But the deleted call logs contained incoming numbers that had not been added to the contacts. How can I get them back?"
