      Many Honor X7b users feel depressed when all of their phone pictures have been erased after you factory reset phone, format SIM card or delete data accidentally. So is there any solution to recover pictures after factory reset Honor X7b?

    <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/aiseesoft-android-data-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Android Data Recovery</strong></a> is a powerful data recovery solution I came across recently. I have tried several recovery tools in last week and Android Data Recovery is the best among them for its recovery ability and simple user interface. Only 3 steps are involved in the whole recovery process to get back lost or deleted pictures, contacts, text messages, media files and documents. You trigged the recover button, and then handle it over to the software. Grab a cup of coffee, then your lost pictures of Honor X7b will come back after your return.
