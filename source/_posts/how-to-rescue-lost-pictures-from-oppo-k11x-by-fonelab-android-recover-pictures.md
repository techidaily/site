    "Accidentally lost all my pictures on Oppo K11x after I updated my Oppo K11x, and forgot to back them up. What should I do to recover my missing pictures from my Oppo K11x without backup? Any advice will be appreciated."

    <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/aiseesoft-android-data-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Android Data Recovery</strong></a> is a powerful data recovery solution I came across recently. I have tried several recovery tools in last week and Android Data Recovery is the best among them for its recovery ability and simple user interface. Only 3 steps are involved in the whole recovery process to get back lost or deleted pictures, contacts, text messages, media files and documents. You trigged the recover button, and then handle it over to the software. Grab a cup of coffee, then your lost pictures of Oppo K11x will come back after your return.

        That’s all for how to recover deleted pictures from Oppo K11x with or without backups. If you still can’t find your deleted pictures, it means they have been overwritten and cannot be recovered anymore. To avoid such situation in the future, you’d better backup your Oppo K11x regularly.
