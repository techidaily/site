    If your music downloads appear to be lost: don't panic! Unless the medium on which they are stored has been physically damaged, there is still a good chance that they can be recovered However, the chances of recovery depend on how many times the disk, memory card or music player have been written to since the files disappeared. If you have filled up the memory card of Itel A60 with new music then your old songs will have been overwritten. If not, then don't write to the player, disc or memory card any more until all the options for recovering the audio files have been exhausted.
