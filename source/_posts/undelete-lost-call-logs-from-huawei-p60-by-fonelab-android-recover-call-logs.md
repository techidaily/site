    <li><b>Accidental Deletion</b> - Mistaken operation from users is one of the main reasons for deleting call log files from your Huawei P60 device. For example, actions like pressing delete keys, emptying of recycle bin, improper use of command prompt, accidentally deleting while using third party application are part of reasons where we lose our call history.</li>
    <li><b>Virus Attack</b> - Some call logs are deleted due to presence of virus in the system.</li>
    <li><b>Improper File Transfer</b> - While transferring call history from one device to another, there are situations when data is lost. It can’t be found in either of the storage.</li>
    <li><b>Formatting Error</b> - A formatting error can give you hard time while connecting an external drive, SD card etc. to your computer. At such instances, there is a threat of loss of your call logs from Huawei P60.</li>
