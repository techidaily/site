    You might delete calls from your Huawei P60’s call-logs history that you didn’t mean to delete or to which you might need to refer later. You might also want to see the deleted call-log history on someone Huawei P60 like your spouse’s Huawei P60 to see what he’s been up to.
    Once calls are deleted from your Huawei P60, they are still located on the device’s SIM card. Regardless of the reason, you can retrieve a deleted call-log history with the appropriate recovery tool.
