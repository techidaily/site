    It is completely normal to accidentally delete the phone number of a friend or co-worker when you are attempting to add a new email address or a new number. Or when the virus has attacked your HTC U23 Pro system, all data, including the contacts information stored in the phone is subject to be damaged. When the contacts information is lost for some reason, they are obliged to collect them through every means they can imagine sweetly with tiny outcomes. Otherwise, they just stand to bear the loss and inconvenience caused by the loss of contacts.
