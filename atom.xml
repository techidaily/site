In this guide, we will discuss the best ways to hard reset your Vivo Y78+ device. We will also provide you with some tips and tricks to help you avoid common issues that may arise during the process.</p><p>Do you want to hard reset your Vivo Y78+ phone? When your phone is not showing its peak performance, it can be very annoying because its working gets slower. If your phone is lagging and apps are not working properly, then there is a problem with its software. The only way to fix this problem is with a hard reset that will restore factory settings in your phone. You can do it to fix your phone or to remove all data if you want to sell it.</p><p>If you are facing some troubles with <strong>Vivo Y78+ hard reset</strong>, then we have the five best ways to factory reset your phone. Each method is best for certain situations, such as if you forget your password, you only want to erase data, or you want to fix software problems. We will give you simple step-by-step tutorials for each method. Although the procedure is simple, it is best to follow each step.</p><h2 id="Using-Vivo-Y78-Hard-Reset-in-What-Situations"><a href="#Using-Vivo-Y78-Hard-Reset-in-What-Situations" class="headerlink" title="Using Vivo Y78+ Hard Reset in What Situations?"></a>Using Vivo Y78+ Hard Reset in What Situations?</h2><h3 id="1-Erase-All-Data-and-Settings"><a href="#1-Erase-All-Data-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1: Erase All Data and Settings"></a>1: Erase All Data and Settings</h3><p>One of the most common reasons for a hard reset is to erase all data and settings from the phone. When your phone runs out of storage, you can only delete the previous data if you want to save something new. Although Vivo Y78+ phones provide a lot of storage and support SD cards, you can only erase unwanted data if you run out of space. Here is the deal, you can save your data on another device like your laptop and do an <strong>Vivo Y78+ hard reset</strong>. This way, you can keep your previous data, make room for new data, and save time.</p><h3 id="2-Restore-Your-Phone-Back-to-Original-Operating-System-and-Apps"><a href="#2-Restore-Your-Phone-Back-to-Original-Operating-System-and-Apps" class="headerlink" title="2: Restore Your Phone Back to Original Operating System and Apps"></a>2: Restore Your Phone Back to Original Operating System and Apps</h3><p>If your phone is working slower than usual or starts lagging, you can do a factory reset instead of wasting time figuring out the problem. Most problems in a phone come from trash file build-up and software updates. Suppose your phone doesn’t work properly after an update. In that case, you can revert it back to the original operating system by using a factory reset. You can also do it if you don’t like an update’s new features and settings. Before your <strong>Vivo Y78+ hard reset</strong>, make sure to backup your data on cloud storage to restore it afterward.</p><h3 id="3-Other-Situations-like-selling-your-phone…"><a href="#3-Other-Situations-like-selling-your-phone…" class="headerlink" title="3: Other Situations (like selling your phone…)"></a>3: Other Situations (like selling your phone…)</h3><p>Aside from the two situations discussed earlier, you might also have to hard reset your phone in other cases. Let’s say you want to buy a new phone or upgrade to a newer model. You will not use your old phone and will probably sell it. Before you sell it, you have to erase all data and personal information like passwords and accounts from your phone. In another scenario, let’s say your phone is stolen or you lost it. All you need to do is use the <strong>Vivo Y78+ hard reset</strong> to ensure no one can access your personal data.</p><h3 id="1-Hard-Reset-from-Settings-if-you-have-password"><a href="#1-Hard-Reset-from-Settings-if-you-have-password" class="headerlink" title="1: Hard Reset from Settings (if you have password)"></a>1: Hard Reset from Settings (if you have password)</h3><p>The easiest way to do an <strong>Vivo Y78+ hard reset</strong> is by using the factory reset option in the settings. This method will erase all data and settings, and you can easily do it in two easy steps. But it only works if you know the password of your phone. If you don’t know the password and the phone is unlocked, it will still require a password for confirmation. Follow these steps for a hard reset from settings.</p><ul><li>Open settings and tap on the “system” option.</li><li>Tap on the “Reset Options” in the system menu.</li><li>Tap on Erase all data or factory reset.</li><li>Enter the Password and tap reset for confirmation.</li><li>The system will erase all data and reboot.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Restore-with-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#2-Restore-with-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2: Restore with Recovery Mode"></a>2: Restore with Recovery Mode</h3><p>Suppose you want to hard reset your locked Vivo Y78+ phone, use the recovery mode. With recovery mode, you don’t have to go to settings and erase data after providing the password. The only drawback of using recovery mode is that it is not best for beginners. Follow these steps for your <strong>Vivo Y78+ hard reset</strong> using recovery mode.</p><ul><li>Power off your mobile phone.</li><li>Hold the volume up and power buttons.</li><li>Enter the menu and navigate using the volume up and down buttons.</li><li>Select Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset using the power button.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Dr-Fone-Data-Eraser-delete-all-data-and-settings"><a href="#3-Dr-Fone-Data-Eraser-delete-all-data-and-settings" class="headerlink" title="3: Dr.Fone - Data Eraser (delete all data and settings)"></a>3: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-data-eraser/" >Dr.Fone - Data Eraser <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (delete all data and settings)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p>If you want to hard reset your phone just to erase all its data and settings, instead of using the long factory reset method, erase data with Dr.Fone. With third-party software like Dr.Fone, you can erase anything from your mobile in one click. It helps you save time, and you don’t have to set up your phone after you are done. You can also restore the erased data using Dr.Fone as well.

Sometimes, a forgotten password might get your tablet locked. At times, the screen of your smartphone or tablet might get stuck and fail to respond. Or your device might come with a non-removable battery to make matters worse. For all these problems and many others, you might want to reset your device. But if your device does not come with a home button or volume buttons, you might want to use a different method. Generally, such devices come with a reset pinhole on the Vivo Y78+ device which can be used to reset the Vivo Y78+ device. To perform a tablet hard reset without the volume button, follow the simple steps described below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14931910627827.jpg"                      alt="choose yes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1: Find the Reset pinhole.</strong></li></ul><p>Look for a very small opening on the back panel or the bezels of a smartphone.

But be careful not to mistake it with the microphone as using it for resetting your gadget may damage the small microphone permanently and lead to other complications.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 2: Insert a pin into the hole.</strong></li></ul><p>After locating it, insert a stretched paperclip or a small pin into the hole and press it for a few seconds.</p><p>Now all the data in your Android device will be reset. After this, you can continue to use your device normally without any problem.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Reset-Android-from-Settings-phone-works-normally"><a href="#Part-4-Reset-Android-from-Settings-phone-works-normally" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reset Android from Settings (phone works normally)"></a>Part 4: Reset Android from Settings (phone works normally)</h2><p>If your Android tablet or smartphone is functioning normally, your device can be reset to the factory settings using just your device itself.

A combination of few button presses including the home button will be the first step to the factory data resetting process. But if there are no physical volume buttons, the process may be quite different from the normal tablets. Only after booting your Android tablet into recovery mode, you will be able to hard reset Android tablet without volume buttons. To know how to reset an Android tablet without volume buttons, follow the steps described below. Remember that this method would only work if your Android device has a home button.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1: Press Power off + home button.</strong></li></ul><p>Press the power button until the options for Power off, Restart, and others appear. Now, tap on the “Power off” option and hold on to it while pressing the home button of your android device at the same time.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 2: Confirm boot into safe mode.</strong></li></ul><p>Now, the screen for rebooting into safe mode will appear. Tap on “Yes” to enter the safe mode.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 3: Enter recovery mode.</strong></li></ul><p>Press and hold the power button as well as the home button of your device simultaneously until a new screen appears. After it appears, release the two buttons and press the power button one more time. Now, press and hold down the home button. With that, you will enter into recovery mode and a new set of options will appear on the screen.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 4: Navigate and do Factory Reset.</strong></li></ul><p>Using the home button to navigate, move down to the “Wipe data&#x2F;factory reset” option. Press the power button to select the option.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/factory-reset-huawei-01.jpg" alt="Wipe data/factory reset"></p><p>You may have to confirm your choice by selecting “Yes”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14925874254055.jpg"                      alt="select yes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5: Reboot your device.</strong></li></ul><p>After the reset is complete, navigate to the “reboot system now” option and select it to reboot your device.

Sometimes, a forgotten password might get your tablet locked. At times, the screen of your smartphone or tablet might get stuck and fail to respond. Or your device might come with a non-removable battery to make matters worse. For all these problems and many others, you might want to reset your device. But if your device does not come with a home button or volume buttons, you might want to use a different method. Generally, such devices come with a reset pinhole on the Sony Xperia 1 V device which can be used to reset the Sony Xperia 1 V device. To perform a tablet hard reset without the volume button, follow the simple steps described below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14931910627827.jpg"                      alt="choose yes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1: Find the Reset pinhole.</strong></li></ul><p>Look for a very small opening on the back panel or the bezels of a smartphone. Usually, such pinholes are marked “Reset” or “Reboot” and are available on the top left side of the back panel. But be careful not to mistake it with the microphone as using it for resetting your gadget may damage the small microphone permanently and lead to other complications.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 2: Insert a pin into the hole.</strong></li></ul><p>After locating it, insert a stretched paperclip or a small pin into the hole and press it for a few seconds.</p><p>Now all the data in your Android device will be reset. After this, you can continue to use your device normally without any problem.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Reset-Android-from-Settings-phone-works-normally"><a href="#Part-4-Reset-Android-from-Settings-phone-works-normally" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reset Android from Settings (phone works normally)"></a>Part 4: Reset Android from Settings (phone works normally)</h2><p>If your Android tablet or smartphone is functioning normally, your device can be reset to the factory settings using just your device itself. Even if your device does not have a home button or volume control buttons, this method will be applicable and can be used to reset the Sony Xperia 1 V device. But before using this method to reset your Android device, make sure to back up all the necessary information that you have on your device. You can also sync all the important files to the cloud using your Google account.

We’ve put together a quick guide to let you know what you need to know… and what you need to do. Before we start deleting stuff, however, it’s important to understand what a Factory reset is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Factory-Reset"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Factory Reset?"></a>Part 1: What is Factory Reset?</h2><p>There are two types of reset for every Android device, soft and hard resets. A <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >soft reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is just a way to force the Android operating system to shut down in the event of a freeze and you only risk losing any data which wasn’t saved prior to the reset.</p><p>A hard reset, also known as a factory reset and a master reset, returns the Honor Play 7T device to the condition it was in when it left the factory. Performing a factory reset will permanently delete any and all personal data you have on your device. This includes any personal settings, apps, pictures, documents, and music stored on your device. A factory reset is irreversible, which means before considering taking this step, it is a good idea to back your data and settings up. A factory reset is a great way to purge buggy updates and other malfunctioning software and can give your phone a new lease of life.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-factory-reset-01.jpg"                      alt="facotry reset android"                ></p><h3 id="Signs-You-Need-to-Reset-Phone"><a href="#Signs-You-Need-to-Reset-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Signs You Need to Reset Phone"></a>Signs You Need to Reset Phone</h3><p>You’ll probably already know if your phone needs a reset, but if you’re unsure, look for some of the following signs.

The warning signs are obvious, apps taking forever to load, constant force close notifications, and a battery life shorter than an episode of Westworld. If you recognize these symptoms then listen up, because your phone may be headed for a meltdown and there’s only one thing left to do. It’s time to reset your Android phone.</p><p>Before taking the plunge, there are a number of factors to consider. We’ve put together a quick guide to let you know what you need to know… and what you need to do. Before we start deleting stuff, however, it’s important to understand what a Factory reset is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Factory-Reset"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Factory Reset?"></a>Part 1: What is Factory Reset?</h2><p>There are two types of reset for every Android device, soft and hard resets. A <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >soft reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is just a way to force the Android operating system to shut down in the event of a freeze and you only risk losing any data which wasn’t saved prior to the reset.</p><p>A hard reset, also known as a factory reset and a master reset, returns the Motorola Razr 40 device to the condition it was in when it left the factory. Performing a factory reset will permanently delete any and all personal data you have on your device. This includes any personal settings, apps, pictures, documents, and music stored on your device. A factory reset is irreversible, which means before considering taking this step, it is a good idea to back your data and settings up. A factory reset is a great way to purge buggy updates and other malfunctioning software and can give your phone a new lease of life.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-factory-reset-01.jpg"                      alt="facotry reset android"                ></p><h3 id="Signs-You-Need-to-Reset-Phone"><a href="#Signs-You-Need-to-Reset-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Signs You Need to Reset Phone"></a>Signs You Need to Reset Phone</h3><p>You’ll probably already know if your phone needs a reset, but if you’re unsure, look for some of the following signs. If you recognize any of the following symptoms then a factory reset is probably a good idea.</p><ol><li>If your <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/android-phone-slow.html" >phone is running slowly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you’ve already tried deleting Apps and data, but it hasn’t resolved anything.</li><li>If your <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/apps-keeps-crashing-android.html" >Apps are crashing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or you keep getting ‘force close’ notifications from your operating system.</li><li>If your Apps are taking longer to load than usual, or your browser is running slow.</li><li>If you find your battery life is worse than usual and you need to charge your phone more often.</li><li>If you are selling, exchanging, or just giving your phone away. If you don’t reset it, the new user can gain access to cached passwords, personal details, and even your pictures and videos.</li></ol><p>Remember factory resetting will erase everything on your device, so it’s essential that you back up anything you can’t afford to lose.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Back-Up-Your-Data-Before-Factory-Reset"><a href="#Part-2-Back-Up-Your-Data-Before-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Back Up Your Data Before Factory Reset"></a>Part 2: Back Up Your Data Before Factory Reset</h2><p>There are a number of Android data backup software for PC out there.

And if it is not possible, how to remotely wipe the phone’s data? People can use the Android Device Manager (also referred to as “Find My Device”) and do the exact two things. The best thing about this is that it doesn’t need to be installed as it is inbuilt on all Android Devices.</p><p>Let us look at the following steps to know how to reset Android phones to factory settings from the computer.</p><p><em><strong>Requirements for Android Device Manager to Work:</strong></em></p><p>• It must be activated in the Motorola Razr 40 device administrator settings. Go to settings &gt; Security &gt; Device administrators and check whether ADM is enabled as a device administrator or not.<br>• The location of the Motorola Razr 40 device must be ON<br>• The device must be signed in to a Google account<br>• The device must have an active internet connection<br>• The device should not be switched off<br>• Even if the Motorola Razr 40 device is without SIM, the Google account must be active</p><p><em><strong>Steps to use ADM to wipe or locate any Android Device:</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/hard-reset-android-using-pc-1.jpg"                      alt="go to find my"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Directly go to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/android/find/" >Android Device Manager website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and log in to your account. You will get three options: “Play Sound”, “Secure Device” and “Erase Device”.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the “Play Sound” option will make it raise the alarm, notifying of the location, you can easily locate your Android phone if it is nearby.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click “Secure Device”, you can remotely lock your device with a new passcode, display a custom message on the lock screen, and even track the Motorola Razr 40 device’s location in real-time. It also gives you the option to add a contact number, so anyone who finds your device can reach out to you.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select “Erase Device” to reset your device. Once you select this option, the interface will take over and complete the job. Congratulations! You have successfully used the Android Device Manager (ADM) to reset your Android smartphone.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>So these were the third different methods through which you can hard reset your Android device. Resetting the Motorola Razr 40 device involves removing every data from the Motorola Razr 40 device. The phone gets back to the same state as it was out of the box. Hence, most importantly, do not forget to back up data using Phone Backup and restore beforehand so that you do not end up losing anything important.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Press the power button to select the option.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/factory-reset-huawei-01.jpg" alt="Wipe data/factory reset"></p><p>You may have to confirm your choice by selecting “Yes”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/04/14925874254055.jpg"                      alt="select yes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5: Reboot your device.</strong></li></ul><p>After the reset is complete, navigate to the “reboot system now” option and select it to reboot your device.

The warning signs are obvious, apps taking forever to load, constant force close notifications, and a battery life shorter than an episode of Westworld. If you recognize these symptoms then listen up, because your phone may be headed for a meltdown and there’s only one thing left to do. It’s time to reset your Android phone.</p><p>Before taking the plunge, there are a number of factors to consider. We’ve put together a quick guide to let you know what you need to know… and what you need to do. Before we start deleting stuff, however, it’s important to understand what a Factory reset is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Factory-Reset"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Factory Reset?"></a>Part 1: What is Factory Reset?</h2><p>There are two types of reset for every Android device, soft and hard resets. A <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >soft reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is just a way to force the Android operating system to shut down in the event of a freeze and you only risk losing any data which wasn’t saved prior to the reset.</p><p>A hard reset, also known as a factory reset and a master reset, returns the Poco M6 5G device to the condition it was in when it left the factory. Performing a factory reset will permanently delete any and all personal data you have on your device. This includes any personal settings, apps, pictures, documents, and music stored on your device. A factory reset is irreversible, which means before considering taking this step, it is a good idea to back your data and settings up. A factory reset is a great way to purge buggy updates and other malfunctioning software and can give your phone a new lease of life.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-factory-reset-01.jpg"                      alt="facotry reset android"                ></p><h3 id="Signs-You-Need-to-Reset-Phone"><a href="#Signs-You-Need-to-Reset-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Signs You Need to Reset Phone"></a>Signs You Need to Reset Phone</h3><p>You’ll probably already know if your phone needs a reset, but if you’re unsure, look for some of the following signs. If you recognize any of the following symptoms then a factory reset is probably a good idea.</p><ol><li>If your <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/android-phone-slow.html" >phone is running slowly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you’ve already tried deleting Apps and data, but it hasn’t resolved anything.</li><li>If your <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/apps-keeps-crashing-android.html" >Apps are crashing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or you keep getting ‘force close’ notifications from your operating system.</li><li>If your Apps are taking longer to load than usual, or your browser is running slow.</li><li>If you find your battery life is worse than usual and you need to charge your phone more often.</li><li>If you are selling, exchanging, or just giving your phone away. If you don’t reset it, the new user can gain access to cached passwords, personal details, and even your pictures and videos.</li></ol><p>Remember factory resetting will erase everything on your device, so it’s essential that you back up anything you can’t afford to lose.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Back-Up-Your-Data-Before-Factory-Reset"><a href="#Part-2-Back-Up-Your-Data-Before-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Back Up Your Data Before Factory Reset"></a>Part 2: Back Up Your Data Before Factory Reset</h2><p>There are a number of Android data backup software for PC out there. Having a Google account will help you save your contacts and settings, but it won’t save your pictures, documents, or music. There are numerous cloud-based systems available like Dropbox and Onedrive where your data is saved onto a cloud-based server, but you’ll need a data connection or wi-fi to restore to your device and of course, you are trusting a third party with your data. We recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >Dr.Fone Basic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Open your phone, drag down the ‘Options’ menu and select the ‘Settings’ menu. Look for the little cog in the top right of your screen.</p><p>Step 2.

Resetting Your Phone in Recovery Mode"></a>Method 2. Resetting Your Phone in Recovery Mode</h3><p>If your phone is misbehaving it might be easier to reset it via Recovery Mode. To do this you must turn your device off first.</p><p>Step 1. Press and hold the Volume up button and the Power button at the same time. The phone will now boot in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/enter-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="factory reset from recovery mode"                ></p><p>Step 2.

Resetting Your Phone Remotely With Android Device Manager"></a>Method 3. Resetting Your Phone Remotely With Android Device Manager</h3><p>You can also perform a factory reset by using the Android Device manager App. Obviously, you’ll need to have Android Device Manager installed on your phone for which you’ll need a Google Account.</p><p>Step 1. Sign in to the App and locate your device on whatever medium you are currently using. With Android Device Manager it is possible to Factory Reset a device remotely by using a PC or other device, but your phone must be logged into your Google account and have an active internet connection.</p><p>Step 2.

The warning signs are obvious, apps taking forever to load, constant force close notifications, and a battery life shorter than an episode of Westworld. If you recognize these symptoms then listen up, because your phone may be headed for a meltdown and there’s only one thing left to do. It’s time to reset your Android phone.</p><p>Before taking the plunge, there are a number of factors to consider. We’ve put together a quick guide to let you know what you need to know… and what you need to do. Before we start deleting stuff, however, it’s important to understand what a Factory reset is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Factory-Reset"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Factory Reset?"></a>Part 1: What is Factory Reset?</h2><p>There are two types of reset for every Android device, soft and hard resets. A <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >soft reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is just a way to force the Android operating system to shut down in the event of a freeze and you only risk losing any data which wasn’t saved prior to the reset.</p><p>A hard reset, also known as a factory reset and a master reset, returns the Samsung Galaxy A05s device to the condition it was in when it left the factory. Performing a factory reset will permanently delete any and all personal data you have on your device. This includes any personal settings, apps, pictures, documents, and music stored on your device. A factory reset is irreversible, which means before considering taking this step, it is a good idea to back your data and settings up. A factory reset is a great way to purge buggy updates and other malfunctioning software and can give your phone a new lease of life.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-factory-reset-01.jpg"                      alt="facotry reset android"                ></p><h3 id="Signs-You-Need-to-Reset-Phone"><a href="#Signs-You-Need-to-Reset-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Signs You Need to Reset Phone"></a>Signs You Need to Reset Phone</h3><p>You’ll probably already know if your phone needs a reset, but if you’re unsure, look for some of the following signs. If you recognize any of the following symptoms then a factory reset is probably a good idea.</p><ol><li>If your <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/android-phone-slow.html" >phone is running slowly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you’ve already tried deleting Apps and data, but it hasn’t resolved anything.</li><li>If your <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-issue/apps-keeps-crashing-android.html" >Apps are crashing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or you keep getting ‘force close’ notifications from your operating system.</li><li>If your Apps are taking longer to load than usual, or your browser is running slow.</li><li>If you find your battery life is worse than usual and you need to charge your phone more often.</li><li>If you are selling, exchanging, or just giving your phone away. If you don’t reset it, the new user can gain access to cached passwords, personal details, and even your pictures and videos.</li></ol><p>Remember factory resetting will erase everything on your device, so it’s essential that you back up anything you can’t afford to lose.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Back-Up-Your-Data-Before-Factory-Reset"><a href="#Part-2-Back-Up-Your-Data-Before-Factory-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Back Up Your Data Before Factory Reset"></a>Part 2: Back Up Your Data Before Factory Reset</h2><p>There are a number of Android data backup software for PC out there. Having a Google account will help you save your contacts and settings, but it won’t save your pictures, documents, or music. There are numerous cloud-based systems available like Dropbox and Onedrive where your data is saved onto a cloud-based server, but you’ll need a data connection or wi-fi to restore to your device and of course, you are trusting a third party with your data. We recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-backup-and-restore/" >Dr.Fone Basic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s easy to use and will save everything and best of all you know exactly where it is.</p><p>Dr.Fone - Phone Backup (Android) enables you to backup all your data, including contacts, messages, call history, calendar, video and audio files, etc. You can choose to individually back up data or everything directly to your computer and then restore it whenever you like.</p><p>Back up and restore data from your device to a computer with a single click.

Using the Settings Menu To Factory Reset Your Device</h3><p>You can factory data reset your Android device via the settings menu by following these steps.</p><p>Step 1. Open your phone, drag down the ‘Options’ menu and select the ‘Settings’ menu. Look for the little cog in the top right of your screen.</p><p>Step 2. Find the option for ‘Back up and Restore’ (please note - using Google to back up your account is a good idea, but it won’t save your music, documents, or pictures.)</p><p>Step 3. Press the button for ‘Factory Data Reset’ (please note - this is irreversible)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/factory-reset-from-settings.jpg"                      alt="factory reset android from settings menu"                ></p><p>Step 4. If you have done this correctly a little Android robot will appear on your screen as the Samsung Galaxy A05s device resets itself.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Resetting-Your-Phone-in-Recovery-Mode"><a href="#Method-2-Resetting-Your-Phone-in-Recovery-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Resetting Your Phone in Recovery Mode"></a>Method 2. Resetting Your Phone in Recovery Mode</h3><p>If your phone is misbehaving it might be easier to reset it via Recovery Mode. To do this you must turn your device off first.</p><p>Step 1. Press and hold the Volume up button and the Power button at the same time. The phone will now boot in Recovery Mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/enter-recovery-mode.jpg"                      alt="factory reset from recovery mode"                ></p><p>Step 2.

Using the volume buttons scroll to ‘wipe data&#x2F;factory reset’ and then press the Power button.</p><p>Step 6. Scroll to ‘Yes - erase all user data’ and to complete the process press the Power button.</p><p>Please note: Devices running Android 5.1 or above, will still require you to enter your Google Password to complete this reset.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Resetting-Your-Phone-Remotely-With-Android-Device-Manager"><a href="#Method-3-Resetting-Your-Phone-Remotely-With-Android-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Resetting Your Phone Remotely With Android Device Manager"></a>Method 3. Resetting Your Phone Remotely With Android Device Manager</h3><p>You can also perform a factory reset by using the Android Device manager App. Obviously, you’ll need to have Android Device Manager installed on your phone for which you’ll need a Google Account.</p><p>Step 1. Sign in to the App and locate your device on whatever medium you are currently using. With Android Device Manager it is possible to Factory Reset a device remotely by using a PC or other device, but your phone must be logged into your Google account and have an active internet connection.</p><p>Step 2. Select erase all data. This is particularly effective if you have lost or had your phone stolen and your device is running Android 5.1 or higher as whoever has your phone will still need your Google Password to be able to reset the Phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/android-device-mamager-erase.jpg"                      alt="factory reset from recovery mode"                ></p><p>Please note: this reset will also delete Android Device Manager and you will therefore be unable to locate or track your device.</p><p>Once you have successfully reset your Android device to its factory settings, all you need to do is restore your original data. After you’ve completed this step your device should be just like new.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Restoring-Your-Phone-After-a-Reset"><a href="#Part-4-Restoring-Your-Phone-After-a-Reset" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Restoring Your Phone After a Reset"></a>Part 4: Restoring Your Phone After a Reset</h2><p>It can be quick and scary seeing your phone return to its original state. But don’t panic. Your data is still safely tucked away on your computer. To restore your contacts and Apps just connect your Samsung Galaxy A05s to the Internet and login into your Google account when prompted.</p><p>Once you have restarted your mobile, connect it to your PC and open Dr.Fone on your computer. Select Phone Backup, and click on the Restore button to start restoring the data to your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-backup-and-restore-1.png"                      alt="restore from backups"                ></p><p>Dr.Fone will display all the backup files.

You can click Restore to Device to restore them all to your phone or just select individual data to restore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-backup-and-restore-6.png"                      alt="restore from backups"                ></p><p>Once you’ve successfully completed your first reset, you’ll realize how simple the whole process is and the next time you need to perform one, you’ll be able to do it with your eyes closed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/security.svg"                      alt="safe Download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Are-You-Preparing-to-Exchange-Your-Phone"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Are-You-Preparing-to-Exchange-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Are You Preparing to Exchange Your Phone?"></a>Bonus Tip: Are You Preparing to Exchange Your Phone?</h2><p>After factory resetting your Android Phone, your phone should work smoothly. But what should we do if your phone is still not working as before? The App still crashes or your phone is still running slow, which may be caused by an old operating system or the phone is too old. It is time to change to a new phone. In this case, you may want to switch the data from the old phone to the new phone.
